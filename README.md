**Signate** (Japanese competition platform for Data Scientists) opened a financial competition from 29th Jan. 2021 through the end of June 2021. The competition called : **Fundamentals Analysis Challenge supported by Japan Exchange Group** (https://signate.jp/competitions/423).  
It attracted large atthention as a first massive educational competition to improve financial literacy for the individual investors in Japan.  Among all, the quality of the official tutorial calls a certain level of reputation, and many potential investors or novice of data scientists have got to know the competion after it is finished.

Contrast to Kaggle platform, Signate suspends the distribution of datasets as soon as the competition closes. Also late submission system doesn't work after the period. It's regulation forces all participants to delete the distributed data as well. Therefore there is no legal way to follow up the reputational tutorials due to lack of data. 

This repository via GitPod provides a sample data from a 3rd party, Quandl(https://www.quandl.com/tools/api) - a NASDAQ platform -,  in order to self-educate the financial data basics with the competition notebook code.

Last but not least, Signate has annonced the intention to publish "signate quest" for this competition around the August 2021. We highly recommend to check and follow the official site : https://quest.signate.jp/
